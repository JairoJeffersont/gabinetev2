/**
 * Logger Class
 * 
 * The `Logger` class is responsible for recording log messages in files.
 * The main goal is to provide an easy way to log relevant information in the system,
 * whether for debugging, auditing, or monitoring, with the ability to categorize logs by levels (INFO, ERROR, DEBUG, etc).
 * 
 * Logs are stored in specific files within a log directory, with the date in the file name,
 * and each log message is formatted with a timestamp and level.
 *

     * Logs a message to a specific file.
     *
     * This method writes a log message to a file inside the 'logs' directory. The file name is generated
     * from the current date and the provided base name. If the 'logs' directory does not exist, it will be created automatically.
     * 
     * The log message includes a timestamp and the specified log level (INFO, ERROR, DEBUG, etc.).
     * The default level is 'INFO'. The file name is also sanitized to ensure there are no invalid characters.
     * 
     * @param string $filename Base name of the log file (without extension). It will be sanitized to avoid invalid characters.
     *                         The file name will consist of the date and the provided name.
     * 
     * @param string $message Message to be logged. It can be any text or variable that needs to be recorded.
     * 
     * @param string $level Log level (INFO, ERROR, DEBUG, etc.). The level helps categorize messages. The default value is 'INFO'.
     *                      Examples of levels include:
     *                      - 'INFO': informational messages, usually routine operations.
     *                      - 'ERROR': error or failure messages.
     *                      - 'DEBUG': detailed information for debugging.
     * 
     * @return void This method does not return any value. The record is written directly to the log file.
     * 
     * @throws \Exception If there is any problem creating the log directory or writing to the log file, an exception may be thrown.
